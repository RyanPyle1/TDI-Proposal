TDI Preliminary Data Analysis

Two data sets - Chicago Taxi and Chicago Rideshare

Taxi:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew

Rideshare:
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips/m6dm-c72p

The two datasets are disjoint - Taxi from 2013 to mid 2018, while the rideshare only has november and december of 2018

Ridhshare set is small enough to download and analyze locally. Taxi set is ~50gb, and must be done via api

Can look at each individually, as well as combinations e.g. how has the decline of taxis affected rideshares? Where do taxis retain an advantage? Are ridshares most popular where taxis have declined?
